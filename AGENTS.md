# qed

Typed spec-driven development with deterministic verification. Written in Lean 4 with formally proven core orchestration logic.

Follow the code standards in [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md).

## Architecture

```
Main.lean              CLI entry point (qed run, qed parse, qed version)
Qed/
  Types.lean           Core types (VerifyType, AcceptanceCriterion, Spec, LoopState)
  Parser.lean          JSON spec parser (Lean.Json → Spec)
  StateMachine.lean    Pure transition function (proven core)
  Verifier.lean        Verification dispatch (command, agent_review, property, proof)
  Output.lean          JSON result serialization
Qed/Proofs/
  Termination.lean     Loop terminates within maxIterations
  StuckDetection.lean  Stuck iff same failures for stuckThreshold iterations
  NoSkip.lean          Cannot skip verification phase
  FinalStates.lean     Terminal states are absorbing
  Monotonic.lean       Iteration count is non-decreasing
Tests/
  Main.lean            Test driver
```

## Key design principle

The orchestrator is a **deterministic state machine**. LLMs are tools used by the orchestrator (as workers and reviewers), never the control plane. The pure transition function (`Qed.StateMachine.transition`) has no IO — all proofs reason about this function.

## Dev environment

Devbox + elan. Devbox provides elan (Lean version manager) via Nix. The `lean-toolchain` file pins the exact Lean version.

```bash
direnv allow          # or: devbox shell
```

First run downloads the Lean toolchain via elan (~500MB). Subsequent runs are instant.

## Commands

```bash
devbox run build      # lake build
devbox run test       # lake test
devbox run check      # build + test
```

Or directly (inside devbox shell / after direnv allow):

```bash
lake build            # build the qed binary
lake test             # run tests
.lake/build/bin/qed   # run the binary
```

## Repo-specific conventions

- **`autoImplicit` is off** — all variables must be explicitly declared. Avoids surprises in theorem proving
- **Pure core, IO shell** — the state machine transition function is pure. IO (process spawning, file reading, JSON output) lives in `Main.lean` and `Verifier.lean`
- **No `sorry`** — proofs must be complete. `sorry` is a placeholder that marks unfinished proofs; CI rejects any `sorry` in `Qed/Proofs/`
- **Tests cover behavior, proofs cover properties** — tests verify that the CLI works end-to-end; proofs verify that the state machine has the right mathematical properties

## Git workflow

### PR workflow

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes, test with `lake build` and `lake test`
3. Push and create PR
4. Review loop: wait for CI + Copilot -> address comments -> push -> iterate until clean
5. Merge

### Issue tracking

GitHub Issues for implementation tracking. Linear for higher-level planning (workspace: tskovlund, project: qed).

**Templates:** Enhancement, Bug, Research. Use the appropriate template. Blank issues disabled.

**Labels:** `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `research`, `dependencies`, `github actions`, `spec`
